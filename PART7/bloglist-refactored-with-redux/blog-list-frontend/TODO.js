/*
1. refactor Redux reducer / store modules

2. perhaps use customHook for API calls? (blogService and users.getAll in User Component)

3. check if useRef need to be added. confirmed `create new blog` auto form wrap-up is broken..
<Togglable buttonLabel="create new blog">

4. consider adding comments to blog require auth token.

5. considering introducing form input custom hook for comments form and
new blog form.
